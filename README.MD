- loop tasks
> abramiyan tasks.
> For1. Integers K and N (N > 0) are given. Output N times the number K

> For2. Given two integers A and B (A < B). Sort everything in ascending order
integers located between A and B (including the numbers A and B themselves), and
also the number N of these numbers.

> for3. Given two integers A and B (A < B). List all in descending order
integers between A and B (not including numbers A and B), and
also the number N of these numbers.

- if tasks

> If24. For a given real x, find the value of the following function f,
taking real values: 
f (x) = 2 sin(x) if x > 0,
6 − x if x ≤ 0.

> If25. For a given integer x, find the value of the following function f, which takes values ​​of an integer type:
f (x) = 2 x if x < −2 or x > 2,
−3 x, otherwise

> If26◦
. For a given real x, find the value of the following function f,
taking real values:
−x if x ≤ 0,
f(x)=x
2
, if 0 < x < 2,
4 if x ≥ 2.

> If27. For a given real x, find the value of the following function f,
accepting values ​​of an integer type:
0 if x < 0,
f (x) = 1 if x belongs to [0, 1), [2, 3), . . . ,
−1 if x belongs to [1, 2), [3, 4), . . . .

> If28. The number of the year (a positive integer) is given. Determine quantity
days this year, given that a normal year has 365 days, and
leap year - 366 days. A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4
except for those years that are divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400
(for example, the years 300, 1300, and 1900 are not leap years, but 1200 and 2000 are).

> If29. Given an integer. Print its description string like "negative
even number”, “zero number”, “positive odd number”, etc.

>  If30. You are given an integer in the range 1–999. Print its description string like "even two-digit number", "odd three-digit number"
etc.
